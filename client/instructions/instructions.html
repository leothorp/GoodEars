<h2>Welcome to the Sonority Generator!</h2>
<p class='instruction'>This is a simple vehicle for sound exploration.  The top slider is the master volume for the entire app. To create an oscillator, click the 'Add button'.
Each oscillator has a start button and sliders for volume and frequency.  Frequency can also be controlled by typing a number into the top text box; you can then use the arrow keys to fine tune the inputted frequency.  To control the step size when using the slider or arrow keys, use the second input box.  Create your own sonorities or randomly generate them with the 'Randomize' and 'Start Progression' options.  Any combination of frequencies is possible, so get ready to hear some exotic sounds ;)</p>
<p class='instruction'>For a more traditional instrumental experience, use the piano keyboard with your mouse or home row keys.  By default, it is set to the familiar frequencies of the western equal tempered scale.  However, you can change the interval (in cents) between adjacent keys with the input box.</p>
<p class='instruction'>Lastly, you can combine these two tools for a unique musical experience.  try setting up a drone with some oscillators, then playing a melody over it on the keyboard...or try to keep up with a random progression.  Open your ears, and enjoy!</p>
